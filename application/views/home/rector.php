                <div class="teacher-info text-justify">
                    <p>You are welcome to Deo Gratias polytechnic platform. I am George Odabi, Doctorate and professor. I come from a family of parents who are passionate, very passionate about education. My mother, lady Odabi, with the active support of my late father (may his soul in peace), started off with a nursery school within the staff quarters of the university of Nigeria Nsukka in 1970, I was blessed to be in the first student number 001. That seed grew to become a primary and secondary school. Having been born into and bred in that sector, I did not think of anywhere else to develop, not invest, on my return to Nigeria after a sojourn in the USA. Hence, today, we have Deo Gratias International Group of Schools in Garki, Gwarimpa, Sunnyvale and Mabushi, Games Village, Guzape, FHA all in Abuja and still counting.
                    </p>
                    <p>Being an indigene of Alisor-Agbor, it will be antithetical, if not absurd, for one of such seeds not to be planted in my home soil. And so we have a Deo Gratias school at Agbor.
                    </p>
                    <p>All the schools have full complement of cr√®che, nursery, primary and secondary tiers. Not done, we are here landed on Deo Gratias Polytechnic platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>Deo Gratias Polytechnic has the vision and mission to lift Nigeria youths to unimaginable levels. We have a working arrangement with Anioma Open University, the first private Open University in Nigeria.
                    </p>
                    <p>The ramification will unfold with time and you will be very lucky to be a beneficiaries.
                    </p>
                    <p>My dear students, actually my children as I prefer to call you, will be exposed to an exchange programme with Tertiary Institution in St Vincent and Grenadines in Central America. The Details are fascinating.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am not an investor but a developer in education industry. You will be an envy of your peers elsewhere.
                    </p>
                    <p>You are welcome to Deo Gratias Polytechnic.
